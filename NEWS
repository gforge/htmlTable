Changes for 1.2

Changes for 1.1
-----------------
* Added the option of having an attribute on the rgroup in case there is an interest
  of adding more data to that particular row
* Added a fix for the pandoc tab bug
* knit_print implemented removing the need for results='asis' except for within for-loops

* txtRound now also rounds character matrices
* Added a detailed vignette with the primary features of htmlTable
* Added the option of having a total row
* The pos.caption can now also be "below"
* Fixed minor bug with numbering not beeing turned off with options(table_counter = FALSE)
* Zebra striping now works for rgroups mixed with ""
* txtRound returns "" by default if value missing. This can also be specified with the
  txt.NA option

Changes for 1.0
-----------------
* The htmlTable and associated txt-functions are now separated from Gmisc
* Argument name changes for htmlTable for better consistency and logic:
    rowname -> rnames
    headings -> header
    halign -> align.header
    cgroup.just -> align.cgroup
    rgroupCSSstyle -> css.rgroup
    rgroupCSSseparator -> css.rgroup.sep
    tspannerCSSstyle -> css.tspanner
    tspannerCSSseparator -> css.tspanner.sep
    tableCSSclass -> css.table.class
    rowlabel.pos -> pos.rowlabel
    caption.loc -> pos.caption
    altcol -> col.rgroup
* htmlTable can now handle rnames = FALSE in order to surpress rownames
* htmlTable now defaults to the layout of ctable as this is the more commonly found layout among medical papers
* htmlTable rgroup has the additional padding.rgroup for those that want to change the no-breaking space padding
* htmlTable tfoot is automatically run through txtMergeLines in order to retain wrapped text
* Renamed splitLines4Table to txtMergeLines, outputInt to txtInt, pvalueFormatter to txtPval and these follow now the argument style of htmlTable
* Added txtRound for rounding matrices. The problem with round() is that 1.01 rounds to 1
  instead of "1.0" that is wanted for output.
* Multiple bug-fixes
